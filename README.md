# m-layer-concept
The idea of an M-layer is to support quantity expressions in digital systems. The M-layer extends conventional units with information about kind of quantity and level of measurement (class of scale). 

The M-layer concept was presented in a [paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.measen.2021.100102) to the 2021 IMEKO World Congress.

The [wiki](https://github.com/apmp-dxfg/m-layer-concept/wiki) has additional information about the design of the `m-layer-concept` software, examples, etc.

This project is intended to demonstrate the M-layer concept and explore implementation choices.
