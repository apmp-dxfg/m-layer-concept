M-Layer

|docs|

The idea of an M-Layer is to support quantity expressions in digital systems. The M-Layer extends conventional units with information about kind of quantity and level of measurement (class of scale). 

The M-Layer concept was presented in a `paper <http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.measen.2021.100102>`_ to the 2021 IMEKO World Congress.

The `wiki <https://github.com/apmp-dxfg/m-layer-concept/wiki>`_ has additional information about the design of the `m-layer-concept` software, examples, etc.

This project is intended to demonstrate the M-Layer concept and explore implementation choices.
