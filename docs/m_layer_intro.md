What is the M-layer?
====================

The *International System of Units* (SI) has a few quirks. For many of the SI units, the unit name can be associated with a particular type of quantity (like the kilogram and the metre are units of mass and length, respectively). So, we get used to thinking that the name of a unit can identify the quantity involved. However, we must rely on the context in which a unit is used to tell us exactly what the quantity is, because some units apply to different quantities. 

There are also problems with temperature. You can express a temperature in kelvin or degrees Celsiusin the SI. However, to convert between kelvin and degrees Celsius requires two arithmetic operations: an addition and a multiplication. No other SI units are handled in that way. Furthermore, a temperature difference can be expressed in kelvin or degrees Celsius. So, you cannot tell from the units if the quantity is a temperature or a temperature difference. Moreover, to convert a temperature difference between kelvin and degrees Celsius *only* involves multiplication (by a conversion factor). So the rules for conversion change according to whether the quantity is a temperature or a temperature difference.

Although these few problems may appear to be just exceptional cases, they are actually due to certain features of measurement scales and units that are not usually explained. 

The M-layer provides rigorous support for these ideas and uses that to represent quantities and units in digital systems.
